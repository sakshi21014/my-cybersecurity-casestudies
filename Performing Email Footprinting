Performing Email Footprinting
Hands-On 5 – Certified Ethical Hacker v12
Author: Sakshi21014

Objective
In this task, I learned how to trace the origin of an email by analyzing its header using eMailTrackerPro.
This helps in identifying where the email actually came from and is useful in detecting spam, phishing, or spoofing attempts.

Tools Used

Windows 11 Virtual Machine

eMailTrackerPro

Email account (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

Steps Performed

Step 1: Installing eMailTrackerPro
I logged in to the Windows 11 VM and started the eMailTrackerPro setup.
I followed the default installation steps and, at the end, unchecked “Show Readme” before clicking Finish.
The software launched automatically after installation.

Step 2: Launching the Application
After launching, an “Edition Selection” pop-up appeared where I clicked OK.
Then the main dashboard of eMailTrackerPro opened.

Step 3: Viewing Trace Reports
From the View section, I clicked on My Trace Reports.
This shows all the traced email headers and their results.

Step 4: Starting a New Trace
I clicked the Trace Headers icon under the New Email Trace section.
Then I chose “Trace an email I have received” and copied the header of a suspicious email to paste it in the given field.

Step 5: Getting Email Headers (Using Gmail)
To find an email header in Gmail:

Open the email.

Click the three dots next to the reply icon.

Select Show original.

A new tab opens with all the technical details.

I copied the entire email header from there.

Step 6: Running the Trace
After pasting the header into eMailTrackerPro, I clicked Trace.
The tool analyzed the email and showed the sender’s route and location on a world map.

Step 7: Checking the Results
The map showed where the email likely came from.
Below that, there was a table listing each hop (server) in the route with its IP address and location.
On the right side, I could see an “Email Summary” with more details about the sender and ISP.

Step 8: Viewing the Full Report
By clicking View Report, I opened the complete trace report in the browser.
It included details such as source and destination IPs, the route taken by the email, ISP and region information, and possible signs of spoofing or spam.

Conclusion
This lab helped me understand how to track and analyze an email’s journey using eMailTrackerPro.
I learned how to find the sender’s real location, the IP addresses involved, and how to detect suspicious or fake emails.
Email footprinting is an important skill for identifying phishing or malicious email sources in ethical hacking.
