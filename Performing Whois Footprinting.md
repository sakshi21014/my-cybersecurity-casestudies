Performing Whois Footprinting
Hands-On 6 – Certified Ethical Hacker v12
Author: Sakshi21014

Objective
In this task, I performed a Whois lookup to gather information about a target domain using DomainTools. This helps find registration details, name servers, IP addresses, and organizational info useful for footprinting.

Tools Used

Windows 11 machine (VM)

Web browser (Edge, Chrome, or Firefox)

DomainTools Whois (whois.domaintools.com)

Steps Performed

Step 1: Open DomainTools
On the Windows 11 machine I opened a web browser and navigated to http://whois.domaintools.com
.

Step 2: Enter the domain
In the search box I typed www.certifiedhacker.com
 and clicked Search.

Step 3: Review the results
The results showed registration and organizational details for the domain, including registrar info, name servers, IP address, and location. I reviewed these fields to understand who controls the domain and where it is hosted.

Step 4: Wrap up
This completes the basic Whois lookup using DomainTools.

Notes and alternatives
You can use other Whois tools if needed, for example SmartWhois (https://www.tamos.com
) or Batch IP Converter (http://www.sabsoft.com
) to gather additional Whois or IP information.

Conclusion
Doing a Whois lookup gives quick background details about a domain that are useful during the reconnaissance phase. It’s a simple but important step in footprinting.
